== WHAT?! ==

This module provides Ubercart/Coova/FreeRadius glue that doesn't require a
CoovaEWT and CoovaRADIUS setup, but does work with just the Hotspot module
and JavaScript controller.


== INSTALLATION ==

Extract the module to your sites/all/modules directory and visit the modules
list page to enable it. It will be listed under 'Other'.

Once enabled, a user with 'administer ubercoova' permission can change the
module configuration on admin/settings/ubercoova.


== CONFIGURATION ==

To make use of the ubercoova module, Drupal needs to be able to access
the FreeRADIUS backend database.

You can configure this database by editing your settings.php file.

Modify the $db_url variable, so that instead of a string it is an array.
The array should have at least a 'default' key that contains the existing
url for the Drupal database. First, change:

  $db_url = 'mysqli://username:password@localhost/databasename';

To:

  $db_url = array();
  $db_url['default'] = 'mysqli://username:password@localhost/drupal';

You can now append the database url for the freeradius database below the
default url. You should give it the key 'radius'.

  $db_url = array();
  $db_url['default'] = 'mysqli://username:password@localhost/drupal';
  $db_url['radius'] = 'mysqli://raduser:radpass@localhost/radius';

The raduser account needs to be able to read from and write to the table
with account credentials and attributes.
